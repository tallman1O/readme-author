# readme-author

![readme-author banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tallman1O/readme-author/main/public/images/mvp.png)

A zero-config CLI tool that analyzes your Node.js project and automatically generates a structured `README.md`.

Run a single command inside your project folder and get a clean, formatted README in seconds.

---

## Installation & Usage

No global install required.

```bash
npx -y readme-author@latest .
```

## Why?

Most developers either:

- Skip writing READMEs  
- Write incomplete documentation  
- Forget installation and execution steps  
- Keep outdated instructions  

`readme-author` removes that friction by generating a consistent, structured README directly from your project configuration.

## Features (v0.1.x – MVP)

- Detects Node.js projects  
- Reads `package.json`  
- Extracts project name and description  
- Lists important npm scripts  
- Generates installation instructions  
- Creates or updates `README.md`  
- Prompts before overwriting existing README files  

No setup. No configuration. No manual input.
